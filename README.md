# Personal-Site
Modern Personal Portfolio Page

This project is a modern personal portfolio page built with React and TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS, and designed with a dark/glassmorphism theme. It includes:
A fixed header with smooth navigation to sections (Home, About, Projects, Contact) and a responsive menu for mobile devices.
Progressive loading animations, a "Back to Top" button, and a modal to preview project images.
An About Me section with key skills, dynamic Projects (featured and additional) with reusable cards, and a grid-based Tech Stack.
A contact form that handles submission statuses, validation, and displays success/error messages, integrated via fetch to an external API.
Persistent cookie consent and accessibility and UX optimization (animations, handling clicks outside the menu, scroll detection).
